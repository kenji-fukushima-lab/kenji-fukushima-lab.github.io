	abstract = {β-Galactoglucomannan (β-GGM) is a primary cell wall polysaccharide in rosids and asterids. The β-GGM polymer has a backbone of repeating glucose and mannose, usually with mono- or di-galactosyl sidechains on the mannosyl residues. CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE 2 (CSLA2), MANNAN α-GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE (MAGT), and MANNAN β-GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE (MBGT) are required for β-GGM synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. The single MBGT identified so far, AtMBGT1, lies in glycosyltransferase family 47A subclade VII, and was identified in Arabidopsis. However, despite the presence of β-GGM, an orthologous gene is absent in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), a model asterid. In this study, we screened candidate MBGT genes from the tomato genome, functionally tested the activities of encoded proteins, and identified the tomato MBGT (SlMBGT1) in GT47A-III. Interestingly therefore, AtMBGT1 and SlMBGT1 are located in different GT47A subclades. Further, phylogenetic and glucomannan structural analysis from different species raised the possibility that various asterids possess conserved MBGTs in GT47A-III, indicating that MBGT activity has been acquired convergently among asterids and rosids. Although functional convergence was observed, the acquired amino acid substitutions among the two MBGT groups were not shared, suggesting different evolutionary pathways to achieve the same biochemical outcome. The present study highlights the promiscuous emergence of donor and acceptor preference in GT47A enzymes, and suggests an adaptive advantage for eudicots to acquire β-GGM β-galactosylation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Subgenome dominance after whole-genome duplication generates distinction in gene number and expression at the level of chromosome sets, but it remains unclear how this process may be involved in evolutionary novelty. Here we generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly of the Asian pitcher plant Nepenthes gracilis to analyse how its novel traits (dioecy and carnivorous pitcher leaves) are linked to genomic evolution. We found a decaploid karyotype and a clear indication of subgenome dominance. A male-linked and pericentromerically located region on the putative sex chromosome was identified in a recessive subgenome and was found to harbour three transcription factors involved in flower and pollen development, including a likely neofunctionalized LEAFY duplicate. Transcriptomic and syntenic analyses of carnivory-related genes suggested that the paleopolyploidization events seeded genes that subsequently formed tandem clusters in recessive subgenomes with specific expression in the digestive zone of the pitcher, where specialized cells digest prey and absorb derived nutrients. A genome-scale analysis suggested that subgenome dominance likely contributed to evolutionary innovation by permitting recessive subgenomes to diversify functions of novel tissue-specific duplicates. Our results provide insight into how polyploidy can give rise to novel traits in divergent and successful high-ploidy lineages.},

Here, we introduce carnivorous plants and their associated organisms — ranging from their prey to their symbionts — and highlight biotic interactions beyond carnivory to discuss how the ‘default’ interactions typical for flowering plants have changed in the case of the carnivorous plants (Figure 1).},

To overcome this problem, we extended the widely used framework of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratios and developed the novel metric ωC, which measures the error-corrected convergence rate of protein evolution. While ωC distinguishes natural selection from genetic noise and phylogenetic errors in simulation and real examples, its accuracy allows an exploratory genome-wide search of adaptive molecular convergence without phenotypic hypothesis or candidate genes. Using gene expression data, we explored over 20 million branch combinations in vertebrate genes and identified the joint convergence of expression patterns and protein sequences with amino acid substitutions in functionally important sites, providing hypotheses on undiscovered phenotypes. We further extended our method with a heuristic algorithm to detect highly repetitive convergence among computationally non-trivial higher-order phylogenetic combinations. Our approach allows bidirectional searches for genotype–phenotype associations, even in lineages that diverged for hundreds of millions of years.},

Thus far, the achlorophyllous orchid genus, Gastrodia, is the only known genus with several plausible completely cleistogamous species. Here, we analyzed the floral developmental transcriptomes of two recently evolved, completely cleistogamous Gastrodia species and their chasmogamous sister species to elucidate the possible changes involved in producing common cleistogamous traits. The ABBA-BABA test did not support introgression and protein sequence convergence as evolutionary mechanisms leading to cleistogamy, leaving convergence in gene expression as a plausible mechanism. Regarding transcriptomic differentiation, the two cleistogamous species had common modifications in the expression of developmental regulators, exhibiting a gene family-wide signature of convergent expression changes in MADS-box genes. Our transcriptomic pseudotime analysis revealed a prolonged juvenile state and eventual maturation, a heterochronic pattern consistent with partial neoteny, in cleistogamous flower development. These findings indicate that transcriptomic partial neoteny, arising from changes in the expression of conserved developmental regulators, might have contributed to the rapid and repeated evolution of cleistogamous flowers in Gastrodia.},

	abstract = {To survive in the nutrient-poor habitats, carnivorous plants capture small organisms comprising complex substances not suitable for immediate reuse. The traps of carnivorous plants, which are analogous to the digestive systems of animals, are equipped with mechanisms for the breakdown and absorption of nutrients. Such capabilities have been acquired convergently over the past tens of millions of years in multiple angiosperm lineages by modifying plant-specific organs including leaves. The epidermis of carnivorous trap leaves bears groups of specialized cells called glands, which acquire substances from their prey via digestion and absorption. The digestive glands of carnivorous plants secrete mucilage, pitcher fluids, acids, and proteins, including digestive enzymes. The same (or morphologically distinct) glands then absorb the released compounds via various membrane transport proteins or endocytosis. Thus, these glands function in a manner similar to animal cells that are physiologically important in the digestive system, such as the parietal cells of the stomach and intestinal epithelial cells. Yet, carnivorous plants are equipped with strategies that deal with or incorporate plant-specific features, such as cell walls, epidermal cuticles, and phytohormones. In this review, we provide a systematic perspective on the digestive and absorptive capacity of convergently evolved carnivorous plants, with an emphasis on the forms and functions of glands.},

Although the concept of botanical carnivory has been known for nearly 150 years, its molecular mechanisms and evolutionary origins have not been well understood until recently. In the last decade, technical advances have fueled the genome and transcriptome sequencings of active and passive hunters, leading to a better understanding of the traits associated with the carnivorous syndrome, from trap leaf development and prey digestion to nutrient absorption, exemplified, for example, by the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula), pitcher plant (Cephalotus follicularis), and bladderwort (Utricularia gibba). The repurposing of defense-related genes is an important trend in the evolution of plant carnivory. In this review, using the Venus flytrap as a representative of the carnivorous plants, we summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying their ability to attract, trap, and digest prey and discuss the origins of plant carnivory in relation to their genomic evolution.},

Although an environment consists of multiple factors, how combinations of these factors influence a reaction norm is not well understood. To elucidate the combinatorial effects of environmental factors, we studied the leaf shape plasticity of the carnivorous pitcher plant Cephalotus follicularis. Clonally propagated plants were subjected to 12-week-long growth experiments in different conditions controlled by growth chambers. Here, we show that the dimorphic response of forming a photosynthetic flat leaf or an insect-trapping pitcher leaf is regulated by two covarying environmental cues: temperature and photoperiod. Even within the normal ranges of temperature and photoperiod, unusual combinations of the two induced the production of malformed leaves that were rarely observed under the environmentally typical combinations. We identified such cases in combinations of a summer temperature with a short-to-neutral day length, whose average frequency in the natural Cephalotus habitats corresponded to a once-in-a-lifetime event for this perennial species. Our results suggest that even if individual cues are within the range of natural fluctuations, a hidden reaction norm can be exposed under their discordant combinations. We anticipate that climate change may challenge organismal responses through not only extreme cues but also through uncommon combinations of benign cues.},

Strikingly, the TPC1 family followed the same conservative evolutionary path as one particular subfamily of Shaker channels (Kout) and remained highly invariant after terrestrialisation, suggesting that electrical signalling was, and remains, key to survival on land. We note that phylogenetic analyses can have pitfalls, which may lead to erroneous conclusions. To avoid these in the future, we suggest guidelines for analyses of ion channel evolution in plants.},

	abstract = {The leaves of the carnivorous plant Venus flytrap, Dionaea muscipula (Dionaea) close rapidly to capture insect prey. The closure response usually requires two successive mechanical stimuli to sensory hairs on the leaf blade within approximately 30 s (refs. 1–4). An unknown biological system in Dionaea is thought to memorize the first stimulus and transduce the signal from the sensory hair to the leaf blade2. Here, we link signal memory to calcium dynamics using transgenic Dionaea expressing a Ca2+ sensor. Stimulation of a sensory hair caused an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) starting in the sensory hair and spreading to the leaf blade. A second stimulus increased [Ca2+]cyt to an even higher level, meeting a threshold that is correlated to the leaf blade closure. Because [Ca2+]cyt gradually decreased after the first stimulus, the [Ca2+]cyt increase induced by the second stimulus was insufficient to meet the putative threshold for movement after about 30 s. The Ca2+ wave triggered by mechanical stimulation moved an order of magnitude faster than that induced by wounding in petioles of Arabidopsis thaliana5 and Dionaea. The capacity for rapid movement has evolved repeatedly in flowering plants. This study opens a path to investigate the role of Ca2+ in plant movement mechanisms and their evolution.},

	abstract = {The origins of multicellular physiology are tied to evolution of gene expression. Genes can shift expression as organisms evolve, but how ancestral expression influences altered descendant expression is not well understood. To examine this, we amalgamate 1,903 RNA-seq datasets from 182 research projects, including 6 organs in 21 vertebrate species. Quality control eliminates project-specific biases, and expression shifts are reconstructed using gene-family-wise phylogenetic Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models. Expression shifts following gene duplication result in more drastic changes in expression properties than shifts without gene duplication. The expression properties are tightly coupled with protein evolutionary rate, depending on whether and how gene duplication occurred. Fluxes in expression patterns among organs are nonrandom, forming modular connections that are reshaped by gene duplication. Thus, if expression shifts, ancestral expression in some organs induces a strong propensity for expression in particular organs in descendants. Regardless of whether the shifts are adaptive or not, this supports a major role for what might be termed preadaptive pathways of gene expression evolution.},

Carnivorous plants have turned the tables by capturing and consuming nutrient-rich animal prey, enabling them to thrive in nutrient-poor soil. To better understand the evolution of botanical carnivory, we compared the draft genome of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) with that of its aquatic sister, the waterwheel plant Aldrovanda vesiculosa, and the sundew Drosera spatulata. We identified an early whole-genome duplication in the family as source for carnivory-associated genes. Recruitment of genes to the trap from the root especially was a major mechanism in the evolution of carnivory, supported by family-specific duplications. Still, these genomes belong to the gene poorest land plants sequenced thus far, suggesting reduction of selective pressure on different processes, including non-carnivorous nutrient acquisition. Our results show how non-carnivorous plants evolved into the most skillful green hunters on the planet.},

	abstract = {Polygonum cuspidatum (Japanese knotweed, also known as Huzhang in Chinese), a plant that produces bioactive components such as stilbenes and quinones, has long been recognized as important in traditional Chinese herbal medicine. To better understand the biological features of this plant and to gain genetic insight into the biosynthesis of its natural products, we assembled a draft genome of P. cuspidatum using Illumina sequencing technology. The draft genome is ca. 2.56 Gb long, with 71.54\% of the genome annotated as transposable elements. Integrated gene prediction suggested that the P. cuspidatum genome encodes 55,075 functional genes, including 6,776 gene families that are conserved in the five eudicot species examined and 2,386 that are unique to P. cuspidatum. Among the functional genes identified, 4,753 are predicted to encode transcription factors. We traced the gene duplication history of P. cuspidatum and determined that it has undergone two whole-genome duplication events about 65 and 6.6 million years ago. Roots are considered the primary medicinal tissue and transcriptome analysis identified 2,173 genes that were expressed at higher levels in roots compared to aboveground tissues. Detailed phylogenetic analysis demonstrated expansion of the gene family encoding stilbene synthase and chalcone synthase enzymes in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway, which is associated with the biosynthesis of resveratrol, a pharmacologically important stilbene. Analysis of the draft genome identified 7 abscisic acid and water deficit stress-induced protein-coding genes and 14 cysteine-rich transmembrane module genes predicted to be involved in stress responses. The draft de novo genome assembly produced in this study represents a valuable resource for the molecular characterization of medicinal compounds in P. cuspidatum, the improvement of this important medicinal plant, and the exploration of its abiotic stress resistance.},

Sequencing of the C. follicularis genome detected adaptive changes that may explain the evolution of traits associated with attraction, trapping, digestion, and absorption. Functional consequences of genes putatively missing in the U. gibba genome, yet present in other angiosperms, may have influenced the evolution of polyploidy, physiology, and a rootless Bauplan. Additional draft nuclear genomes and transcriptomes are available for carnivorous Caryophyllales, Ericales, Lamiales, and Poales, but are limited in quantity and quality.

	abstract = {Phylogenetic inference requires a means to search phylogenetic tree space. This is usually achieved using progressive algorithms that propose and test small alterations in the current tree topology and branch lengths. Current programs search tree topology space using branch-swapping algorithms, but proposals do not discriminate well between swaps likely to succeed or fail. When applied to datasets with many taxa, the huge number of possible topologies slows these programs dramatically. To overcome this, we developed a novel statistical approach for proposal generation in Bayesian analysis, and evaluated its applicability for the problem of searching phylogenetic tree space. The general idea of the approach, which we call 'Markov katana', is to make proposals based on a heuristic algorithm using bootstrapped subsets of the data. Such proposals induce an unintended sampling distribution that must be determined and removed to generate posterior estimates, but the cost of this extra step can in principle be small compared to the added value of more efficient parameter exploration in Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses. Our prototype application uses the simple neighbor joining distance heuristic on data subsets to propose new reasonably likely phylogenetic trees (including topologies and branch lengths). The evolutionary model used to generate distances in our prototype was far simpler than the more complex model used to evaluate the likelihood of phylogenies based on the full dataset. This prototype implementation indicates that the Markov katana approach could be easily incorporated into existing phylogenetic search programs and may prove a useful alternative in conjunction with existing methods. The general features of this statistical approach may also prove useful in disciplines other than phylogenetics. We demonstrate that this method can be used to efficiently estimate a Bayesian posterior.},

Transcriptome comparison of the two leaf types and gene repertoire analysis identified genetic changes associated with prey attraction, capture, digestion and nutrient absorption.

To analyze the phylogenetic relationship of lake cress, we investigated chloroplast DNA sequences from 17 plant species. The results of phylogenetic reconstruction performed using trnL intron, trnG (GCC)-trnM (CAU), and psbC-trnS (UGA) indicated that lake cress is a member of Rorippa. Moreover, we found that the chromosome number of lake cress is 2n = 30. This result indicated that lake cress might have originated from aneuploidy of triploid species or via intergeneric crossing. Taken together, our results suggest an affinity between lake cress and Rorippa at the molecular level, indicating that lake cress should be treated as Rorippa aquatica (Eaton) EJ Palmer \& Steyermark.},

Although members of the complex had conservative symmetric karyotypes, they were clearly differentiated on chromosomal rDNA distribution patterns. The sequence data indicated that ITS was almost homogeneous in all taxa in which two or four 45S rDNA arrays were frequently found at distal regions of chromosomes in the somatic karyotype. ITS homogenization could have been prompted by relatively distal 45S rDNA positions. In contrast, 2-12 5S rDNA arrays were mapped onto proximal/interstitial regions of chromosomes, and some paralogous 5S-NTS were found in the genomes harboring 4 or more arrays. 5S-NTS sequence type-specific FISH analysis showed sequence heterogeneity within and between some 5S rDNA arrays. Interlocus homogenization may have been hampered by their proximal location on chromosomes.

RESULTS Drosera rotundifolia and Drosera tokaiensis fractions, but not the Drosera spatulata fraction, suppressed inflammatory gene expression induced by aTc-m in HMC-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS Drosera rotundifolia and Drosera tokaiensis suppressed activation of HMC-1 cells induced by aTc-m.

The butanol fraction significantly suppressed NFκB DNA binding activity and phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK MAPKs. Components in the active fraction from bitter gourd were identified as 1-α-linolenoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), 2-α-linolenoyl-LPC, 1-lynoleoyl-LPC, and 2-linoleoyl-LPC. Purified 1-α-linolenoyl-LPC and 1-linoleoyl-LPC suppressed the LPS-induced TNFα production of RAW 264.7 cells ...},

	abstract = {Byblis filifolia and B. liniflora had the diploidal and the tetraploidal chromosome numbers of 2n=16 and 32, respectively. In condensation behavior from prophase to metaphase, most chromosomes of both species had early condensing segments at the proximal regions. At prometaphase and early-metaphase, all chromosomes except for some small sized chromosomes had decondense segments at the distal regions in both arms. At mid-metaphase, well-spread chromosomes were quite rare to obtain, because all chromosomes at mid-metaphase stage were quite sticky nature, but not earlier stages of metaphase and prophase. The metaphase chromosomes in both species showed a gradual decrease in size from the largest to the smallest. In B. filifolia, total chromosome length at early-metaphase was 40.5 μm, while total chromosome length at mid-metaphase was 23.3 μm. In contrast, B. liniflora showed total chromosome length of 106.1 μm at early-metaphase, and 54.0 μm at mid-metaphase. To compare to the same stage of metaphase, the total length in B. liniflora was nearly twice as long as that of B. filifolia. Two sat-chromosomes were observed in both species.},
