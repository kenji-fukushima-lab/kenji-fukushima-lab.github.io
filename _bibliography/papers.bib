Although trapping pitchers in both lineages represent some of the most elaborate leaf structures in angiosperms, it remains unknown whether their analogous phenotypes share common molecular foundations, especially at the level of gene expression. Here, we conducted tissue-specific RNA-seq experiments coupled with feeding treatments in C. follicularis, mirroring the available expression dataset of N. gracilis to analyze gene expression evolution underlying the phenotypic convergence. Functionally equivalent tissues in the two species tended to express similar gene sets, with common transcriptional responses that activate amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis upon the feeding treatment, yet with distinct transcriptional regulation of digestive enzyme genes. Additionally, we found multiple cases of combined convergence in expression and protein sequences in genes preferentially expressed in gland-containing tissues. Our study showcases how common and unique transcriptional components are integrated to shape the independent emergence of complex leaf structures in angiosperms.},

    abstract = {Salicylic acid (SA) is a major defense phytohormone. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the isochorismate (IC) pathway is the primary route for pathogen-induced SA biosynthesis. First, the IC synthase (ICS) catalyzes the isomerization of chorismate to IC in chloroplasts. Second, the chloroplast-localized MATE transporter EDS5 appears to transport IC from chloroplasts to the cytosol. Cytosolic IC is then further converted to SA via the GH3 amino acid-conjugating enzyme PBS3. While this pathway is genetically well-characterized in A. thaliana, its evolutionary origin and conservation remain controversial. In this study, through comprehensive phylogenetic, structural, and functional analyses, we demonstrate that the IC pathway emerged within the Brassicales order in a time span between the divergence of Carica papaya and Capparis spinosa. The evolution of the IC pathway was driven by three key adaptations during the time span: 1) enhancement of ICS activity, 2) neofunctionalization of EDS5 after duplication of its ancestral gene, and 3) evolution of a PBS3, whose activity is specialized for glutamate-conjugation to IC. Structural modeling and functional assays reveal that an enhanced salt bridge network in ICS enhanced its activity. One of the duplicated genes, EDS5, acquired key amino acid substitutions in the C-lobe, which contributed to the EDS5 neofunctionalization. In addition, the functional PBS3 clade, including A. thaliana PBS3, is restricted to a Brassicales clade. Taken together, this study addresses the evolutionary trajectory of IC-based SA biosynthesis.},

    volume = {},
    url = {},
    doi = {},
    abstract = {Living in nutrient-poor environments, the carnivorous Venus flytrap Dionaea muscipula captures animal prey to compensate for this deficiency. Stimulation of trigger hairs located on the inner trap surface elicits an action potential (AP). While two consecutive APs result in fast trap closure in wildtype (WT) plants, sustained AP generation by the insect struggling to escape the trap leads to jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, formation of the digestive stomach, and release of enzymes needed to decompose the victim. The Dionaea muscipula DYSCALCULIA (DYSC) mutant is able to fire touch-induced APs, but unlike WT plants, it does not snap-close its traps after two consecutive APs. Moreover, DYSC plants fail to properly initiate the JA pathway in response to mechanostimulation and even wounding, a well-known JA-dependent process conserved among plants. As demonstrated in previous studies, this DYSC mutant defect is associated with impaired decoding of mechanostimulation (i.e. touch) -induced Ca2+ signals. External JA application to the trap, however, restores slow trap closure and digestive gland function in DYSC, while rapid trap closure is JA-independent and cannot be rescued by exogenous JA application. Higher frequency mechanostimulation and thus more APs, however, revealed that DYSC is still able to close its traps, albeit much slower than WT plants. To reveal the molecular underpinnings of DYSCs delayed trap movement, we generated a chromosome scale Dionaea genome assembly and profiled gene expression. The refined transcriptomic analysis uncovered widespread misregulation of cell wall related genes in DYSC, implicating altered cell wall plasticity in the sluggish mutant. Cell indentation studies by atomic force microscopy revealed a strictly localized and strikingly enhanced stiffening of the cell wall for DYSC that may hinder rapid trap closure and snap buckling. Together, these genomic, transcriptomic, and biophysical data identify cell wall elasticity as a key constraint on voltage and Ca2+ dependent trap kinetics. This finding documents the interrelationship between mechanosensing and Ca2+ signaling in the ultrafast capture organ of the Venus flytrap.},

    abstract = {Despite a long-standing interest since Darwin’s time, the genomic implications of obligate self‐fertilization remain elusive. Complete cleistogamy—the obligate production of closed, self‐pollinating flowers—represents an extreme reproductive strategy. Here, we present the genomic profiles and evolutionary history of two lineages of the mycoheterotrophic orchid Gastrodia, both of which independently acquired complete cleistogamy, based on detailed sampling and a combination of simple sequence repeat (SSR), multiplexed ISSR genotyping by sequencing (MIG-seq) and RNA‐seq data. Our analysis reveals clear species delimitation, with no evidence of introgression between the completely cleistogamous species and their co‐occurring allogamous sisters. Intriguingly, all analyses indicate that both the completely cleistogamous Gastrodia species and their allogamous sisters exhibit genetic profiles typical of self‐pollinating plants. This pattern suggests that their ancestors, probably bearing allogamous flowers, had already evolved mechanisms to mitigate the deleterious effects of selfing, potentially facilitating the emergence of complete cleistogamy through benefits such as reproductive assurance, enhanced colonization ability and species reinforcement. Meanwhile, further analyses suggest that complete cleistogamy evolved very recently (possibly within the last 1000–2000 years) in these two Gastrodia lineages. Combined with the scant evidence of complete cleistogamy outside Gastrodia, our findings imply a limited and ephemeral role for complete cleistogamy in plant speciation.},

    abstract = {Plants emit a large amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere, reaching approximately 109 tons of carbon per year. These biogenic VOCs exhibit significant chemical diversity, with terpenoids being the dominant group, and isoprene accounting for nearly half of the total biogenic VOCs. Due to its high chemical reactivity, isoprene has a strong impact on atmospheric quality and climate. Quercus species (Fagaceae) are known to be the main isoprene emitters in the Northern Hemisphere. However, isoprene synthase is unknown in the entire Fagaceae family. Notably, even within a single genus such as Quercus, both isoprene-emitting and non-emitting species are present, yet the molecular basis of this dichotomy remains unclear. Here, we report the identification of the IspS gene from the isoprene-emitting species Quercus serrata (QsIspS1) through seasonal transcriptome analysis and its detailed biochemical characterization. We also identified two genes with high sequence similarity to QsIspS1 in the genomes of non-emitting species: Q. glauca (QgIspS1-like) and Lethocarpus edulis (LeIspS1-like). We discovered mutations in these sequences that likely impair their function. Biochemical analysis revealed that QgIspS1-like is a monoterpene synthase, whereas LeIspS1-like is a pseudogene incapable of isoprene synthesis, explaining these plants' inability to emit isoprene. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis revealed an amino acid that plays a pivotal role in the substrate and product specificities of isoprene synthase. Our findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of isoprene emission diversity in Fagaceae.},

DSS is derived from methanethiol oxidase (MTOX), an enzyme conserved among animals and plants, and similar DSS enzymes have independently evolved in two other plant genera. Three amino acid changes shared among the DSSs of independent origins were sufficient to cause a functional switch between MTOX and DSS.

    abstract = {Across evolutionary scales, lineages acquire and lose traits and associated genes. Most land plants form arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, an ancient trait for enhanced nutrition that was convergently lost in some clades. Carnivory, another nutritional trait, is a more recent adaptation that has convergently arisen in several angiosperm orders. The two biotic interactions similarly help plants acquire mineral nutrients, raising the question of whether they can coexist. However, the mycorrhizal status of carnivorous plants has long remained speculative. Here, we surveyed the occurrence of AM-associated genes in five angiosperm orders harbouring carnivorous species, revealing convergent losses of the AM trait either coincident with or predating the emergence of carnivory. Exceptionally, the carnivorous plant species Roridula gorgonias retains symbiosis-related genes and forms arbuscules upon inoculation assays, demonstrating the two nutritional strategies, although rare, can coexist. The youngest carnivorous lineage, Brocchinia reducta, showed signatures of the early stages of AM trait loss, as reflected by its gene retention and AM colonization patterns. An AM-associated CHITINASE gene encodes a digestive enzyme in the Australian pitcher plant Cephalotus, suggesting gene co-option. These findings illuminate the largely unexplored processes by which plant nutritional strategies evolve and supplant one another over time.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Leaf economic theory holds that physiological constraints to photosynthesis have a role in the coordinated evolution of multiple leaf traits, an idea that can be extended to carnivorous plants occupying a particular trait space that is constrained by key costs and benefits. Pitcher traps are modified leaves that may face steep photosynthetic costs: a high-volume, three-dimensional tubular structure may be less efficient than a flat lamina. While past research has investigated the photosynthetic costs of pitchers, the exact suite of constraints shaping pitcher trait variation remain under-explored—including constraints to carnivorous function. In this review, we describe various constraints arising from the dual photosynthetic and carnivorous functions of pitchers arising from developmental, functional, budgetary, and environmental factors. In addition, we identify the data required to establish the leaf economic spectrum (LES) for carnivorous pitcher plants (CPPs), and — owing to the multifunctional roles of pitcher leaves — discuss difficulties in placing pitchers onto existing frameworks. Because pitcher traps serve multiple functions, both photosynthesis and nutrient acquisition (carnivory), they are difficult to place in the context of the LES, especially in light of a current lack of trait data. We describe a spectrum across the independent CPP lineages in approaches to balancing carnivory-photosynthesis tradeoffs. Future efforts to collect relevant data can clarify the forces that shape observed pitcher trait variation, and increase understanding of principles that may be ultimately generalized to other plants.},

	abstract = {β-Galactoglucomannan (β-GGM) is a primary cell wall polysaccharide in rosids and asterids. The β-GGM polymer has a backbone of repeating β-(1,4)-glucosyl and mannosyl residues, usually with mono-α-(1,6)-galactosyl substitution or β-(1,2)-galactosyl α-galactosyl disaccharide side chains on the mannosyl residues. Mannan β-galactosyltransferases (MBGTs) are therefore required for β-GGM synthesis. The single MBGT identified so far, AtMBGT1, lies in glycosyltransferase family 47A subclade VII and was identified in Arabidopsis. However, despite the presence of β-GGM, an orthologous gene is absent in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), a model asterid. In this study, we screened candidate MBGT genes from the tomato genome, functionally tested the activities of encoded proteins and identified the tomato MBGT (SlMBGT1) in GT47A-III. Interestingly therefore, AtMBGT1 and SlMBGT1 are located in different GT47A subclades. Furthermore, phylogenetic and glucomannan structural analysis from different species raised the possibility that various asterids possess conserved MBGTs in an asterid-specific subclade of GT47A-III, indicating that MBGT activity has been acquired convergently among asterids and rosids. The present study highlights the promiscuous emergence of donor and acceptor preference in GT47A enzymes. The independent acquisition of the activity also suggests an adaptive advantage for eudicots to acquire β-GGM β-galactosylation and hence also suggests that the disaccharide side chains are important for β-GGM function.},

Here we generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly of the Asian pitcher plant Nepenthes gracilis to analyse how its novel traits (dioecy and carnivorous pitcher leaves) are linked to genomic evolution. We found a decaploid karyotype and a clear indication of subgenome dominance. A male-linked and pericentromerically located region on the putative sex chromosome was identified in a recessive subgenome and was found to harbour three transcription factors involved in flower and pollen development, including a likely neofunctionalized LEAFY duplicate. Transcriptomic and syntenic analyses of carnivory-related genes suggested that the paleopolyploidization events seeded genes that subsequently formed tandem clusters in recessive subgenomes with specific expression in the digestive zone of the pitcher, where specialized cells digest prey and absorb derived nutrients. A genome-scale analysis suggested that subgenome dominance likely contributed to evolutionary innovation by permitting recessive subgenomes to diversify functions of novel tissue-specific duplicates.

While ωC distinguishes natural selection from genetic noise and phylogenetic errors in simulation and real examples, its accuracy allows an exploratory genome-wide search of adaptive molecular convergence without phenotypic hypothesis or candidate genes. Using gene expression data, we explored over 20 million branch combinations in vertebrate genes and identified the joint convergence of expression patterns and protein sequences with amino acid substitutions in functionally important sites, providing hypotheses on undiscovered phenotypes. We further extended our method with a heuristic algorithm to detect highly repetitive convergence among computationally non-trivial higher-order phylogenetic combinations. Our approach allows bidirectional searches for genotype–phenotype associations, even in lineages that diverged for hundreds of millions of years.},

	abstract = {Cleistogamy, in which plants can reproduce via self-fertilization within permanently closed flowers, has evolved in {\textgreater} 30 angiosperm lineages; however, consistent with Darwin's doubts about its existence, complete cleistogamy – the production of only cleistogamous flowers – has rarely been recognized. Thus far, the achlorophyllous orchid genus, Gastrodia, is the only known genus with several plausible completely cleistogamous species. Here, we analyzed the floral developmental transcriptomes of two recently evolved, completely cleistogamous Gastrodia species and their chasmogamous sister species to elucidate the possible changes involved in producing common cleistogamous traits. The ABBA-BABA test did not support introgression and protein sequence convergence as evolutionary mechanisms leading to cleistogamy, leaving convergence in gene expression as a plausible mechanism. Regarding transcriptomic differentiation, the two cleistogamous species had common modifications in the expression of developmental regulators, exhibiting a gene family-wide signature of convergent expression changes in MADS-box genes. Our transcriptomic pseudotime analysis revealed a prolonged juvenile state and eventual maturation, a heterochronic pattern consistent with partial neoteny, in cleistogamous flower development. These findings indicate that transcriptomic partial neoteny, arising from changes in the expression of conserved developmental regulators, might have contributed to the rapid and repeated evolution of cleistogamous flowers in Gastrodia.},

	abstract = {To survive in the nutrient-poor habitats, carnivorous plants capture small organisms comprising complex substances not suitable for immediate reuse. The traps of carnivorous plants, which are analogous to the digestive systems of animals, are equipped with mechanisms for the breakdown and absorption of nutrients. Such capabilities have been acquired convergently over the past tens of millions of years in multiple angiosperm lineages by modifying plant-specific organs including leaves. The epidermis of carnivorous trap leaves bears groups of specialized cells called glands, which acquire substances from their prey via digestion and absorption. The digestive glands of carnivorous plants secrete mucilage, pitcher fluids, acids, and proteins, including digestive enzymes. The same (or morphologically distinct) glands then absorb the released compounds via various membrane transport proteins or endocytosis. Thus, these glands function in a manner similar to animal cells that are physiologically important in the digestive system, such as the parietal cells of the stomach and intestinal epithelial cells. Yet, carnivorous plants are equipped with strategies that deal with or incorporate plant-specific features, such as cell walls, epidermal cuticles, and phytohormones. In this review, we provide a systematic perspective on the digestive and absorptive capacity of convergently evolved carnivorous plants, with an emphasis on the forms and functions of glands.},

Although the concept of botanical carnivory has been known for nearly 150 years, its molecular mechanisms and evolutionary origins have not been well understood until recently. In the last decade, technical advances have fueled the genome and transcriptome sequencings of active and passive hunters, leading to a better understanding of the traits associated with the carnivorous syndrome, from trap leaf development and prey digestion to nutrient absorption, exemplified, for example, by the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula), pitcher plant (Cephalotus follicularis), and bladderwort (Utricularia gibba). The repurposing of defense-related genes is an important trend in the evolution of plant carnivory. In this review, using the Venus flytrap as a representative of the carnivorous plants, we summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying their ability to attract, trap, and digest prey and discuss the origins of plant carnivory in relation to their genomic evolution.},

Variation in flg22-triggered transcriptome responses across Brassicaceae species was incongruent with their phylogeny, while expression changes were strongly conserved within A. thaliana. We found the enrichment of WRKY transcription factor binding sites in the 5′-regulatory regions of conserved and species-specific responsive genes, linking the emergence of WRKY-binding sites with the evolution of gene expression patterns during PTI.

	abstract = {Organisms withstand normal ranges of environmental fluctuations by producing a set of phenotypes genetically programmed as a reaction norm; however, extreme conditions can expose a misregulation of phenotypes called a hidden reaction norm. Although an environment consists of multiple factors, how combinations of these factors influence a reaction norm is not well understood. To elucidate the combinatorial effects of environmental factors, we studied the leaf shape plasticity of the carnivorous pitcher plant Cephalotus follicularis. Clonally propagated plants were subjected to 12-week-long growth experiments in different conditions controlled by growth chambers. Here, we show that the dimorphic response of forming a photosynthetic flat leaf or an insect-trapping pitcher leaf is regulated by two covarying environmental cues: temperature and photoperiod. Even within the normal ranges of temperature and photoperiod, unusual combinations of the two induced the production of malformed leaves that were rarely observed under the environmentally typical combinations. We identified such cases in combinations of a summer temperature with a short-to-neutral day length, whose average frequency in the natural Cephalotus habitats corresponded to a once-in-a-lifetime event for this perennial species. Our results suggest that even if individual cues are within the range of natural fluctuations, a hidden reaction norm can be exposed under their discordant combinations. We anticipate that climate change may challenge organismal responses through not only extreme cues but also through uncommon combinations of benign cues.},

Strikingly, the TPC1 family followed the same conservative evolutionary path as one particular subfamily of Shaker channels (Kout) and remained highly invariant after terrestrialisation, suggesting that electrical signalling was, and remains, key to survival on land. We note that phylogenetic analyses can have pitfalls, which may lead to erroneous conclusions. To avoid these in the future, we suggest guidelines for analyses of ion channel evolution in plants.},

	abstract = {The leaves of the carnivorous plant Venus flytrap, Dionaea muscipula (Dionaea) close rapidly to capture insect prey. The closure response usually requires two successive mechanical stimuli to sensory hairs on the leaf blade within approximately 30 s (refs. 1–4). An unknown biological system in Dionaea is thought to memorize the first stimulus and transduce the signal from the sensory hair to the leaf blade2. Here, we link signal memory to calcium dynamics using transgenic Dionaea expressing a Ca2+ sensor. Stimulation of a sensory hair caused an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) starting in the sensory hair and spreading to the leaf blade. A second stimulus increased [Ca2+]cyt to an even higher level, meeting a threshold that is correlated to the leaf blade closure. Because [Ca2+]cyt gradually decreased after the first stimulus, the [Ca2+]cyt increase induced by the second stimulus was insufficient to meet the putative threshold for movement after about 30 s. The Ca2+ wave triggered by mechanical stimulation moved an order of magnitude faster than that induced by wounding in petioles of Arabidopsis thaliana5 and Dionaea. The capacity for rapid movement has evolved repeatedly in flowering plants. This study opens a path to investigate the role of Ca2+ in plant movement mechanisms and their evolution.},

Genes can shift expression as organisms evolve, but how ancestral expression influences altered descendant expression is not well understood. To examine this, we amalgamate 1,903 RNA-seq datasets from 182 research projects, including 6 organs in 21 vertebrate species. Quality control eliminates project-specific biases, and expression shifts are reconstructed using gene-family-wise phylogenetic Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models. Expression shifts following gene duplication result in more drastic changes in expression properties than shifts without gene duplication. The expression properties are tightly coupled with protein evolutionary rate, depending on whether and how gene duplication occurred. Fluxes in expression patterns among organs are nonrandom, forming modular connections that are reshaped by gene duplication. Thus, if expression shifts, ancestral expression in some organs induces a strong propensity for expression in particular organs in descendants. Regardless of whether the shifts are adaptive or not, this supports a major role for what might be termed preadaptive pathways of gene expression evolution.},

To better understand the biological features of this plant and to gain genetic insight into the biosynthesis of its natural products, we assembled a draft genome of P. cuspidatum using Illumina sequencing technology. The draft genome is ca. 2.56 Gb long, with 71.54\% of the genome annotated as transposable elements. Integrated gene prediction suggested that the P. cuspidatum genome encodes 55,075 functional genes, including 6,776 gene families that are conserved in the five eudicot species examined and 2,386 that are unique to P. cuspidatum. Among the functional genes identified, 4,753 are predicted to encode transcription factors. We traced the gene duplication history of P. cuspidatum and determined that it has undergone two whole-genome duplication events about 65 and 6.6 million years ago. Roots are considered the primary medicinal tissue and transcriptome analysis identified 2,173 genes that were expressed at higher levels in roots compared to aboveground tissues. Detailed phylogenetic analysis demonstrated expansion of the gene family encoding stilbene synthase and chalcone synthase enzymes in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway, which is associated with the biosynthesis of resveratrol, a pharmacologically important stilbene. Analysis of the draft genome identified 7 abscisic acid and water deficit stress-induced protein-coding genes and 14 cysteine-rich transmembrane module genes predicted to be involved in stress responses. The draft de novo genome assembly produced in this study represents a valuable resource for the molecular characterization of medicinal compounds in P. cuspidatum, the improvement of this important medicinal plant, and the exploration of its abiotic stress resistance.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic inference requires a means to search phylogenetic tree space. This is usually achieved using progressive algorithms that propose and test small alterations in the current tree topology and branch lengths. Current programs search tree topology space using branch-swapping algorithms, but proposals do not discriminate well between swaps likely to succeed or fail. When applied to datasets with many taxa, the huge number of possible topologies slows these programs dramatically. To overcome this, we developed a novel statistical approach for proposal generation in Bayesian analysis, and evaluated its applicability for the problem of searching phylogenetic tree space. The general idea of the approach, which we call 'Markov katana', is to make proposals based on a heuristic algorithm using bootstrapped subsets of the data. Such proposals induce an unintended sampling distribution that must be determined and removed to generate posterior estimates, but the cost of this extra step can in principle be small compared to the added value of more efficient parameter exploration in Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses. Our prototype application uses the simple neighbor joining distance heuristic on data subsets to propose new reasonably likely phylogenetic trees (including topologies and branch lengths). The evolutionary model used to generate distances in our prototype was far simpler than the more complex model used to evaluate the likelihood of phylogenies based on the full dataset. This prototype implementation indicates that the Markov katana approach could be easily incorporated into existing phylogenetic search programs and may prove a useful alternative in conjunction with existing methods. The general features of this statistical approach may also prove useful in disciplines other than phylogenetics. We demonstrate that this method can be used to efficiently estimate a Bayesian posterior.},

To investigate the molecular bases of carnivory, we sequenced the genome of the heterophyllous pitcher plant Cephalotus follicularis, in which we succeeded in regulating the developmental switch between carnivorous and non-carnivorous leaves. Transcriptome comparison of the two leaf types and gene repertoire analysis identified genetic changes associated with prey attraction, capture, digestion and nutrient absorption. Analysis of digestive fluid proteins from C. follicularis and three other carnivorous plants with independent carnivorous origins revealed repeated co-options of stress-responsive protein lineages coupled with convergent amino acid substitutions to acquire digestive physiology. These results imply constraints on the available routes to evolve plant carnivory.},

Part of this morphological diversity can be attributed to differences in spatiotemporal regulation of polarity in the upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) sides of developing leaves. In a leaf primordium, antagonistic interactions between polarity determinants specify the adaxial and abaxial domains in a mutually exclusive manner. The patterning of those domains is critical for leaf morphogenesis. In this review, we first summarize the gene networks regulating adaxial–abaxial polarity in conventional bifacial leaves and then discuss how patterning is modified in different leaf type categories. genesis 1–18. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Lake cress shows heterophyllic changes in leaf form in response to the surrounding environment. Therefore, this species has received considerable attention from ecological and morphological perspectives. However, its phylogenetic position and taxonomic status have long been a subject of debate. To analyze the phylogenetic relationship of lake cress, we investigated chloroplast DNA sequences from 17 plant species. The results of phylogenetic reconstruction performed using trnL intron, trnG (GCC)-trnM (CAU), and psbC-trnS (UGA) indicated that lake cress is a member of Rorippa. Moreover, we found that the chromosome number of lake cress is 2n = 30. This result indicated that lake cress might have originated from aneuploidy of triploid species or via intergeneric crossing. Taken together, our results suggest an affinity between lake cress and Rorippa at the molecular level, indicating that lake cress should be treated as Rorippa aquatica (Eaton) EJ Palmer \& Steyermark.},

In addition, we performed phylogenetic analyses based on rbcL and trnK intron. The complex was divided into 2 clades: B. aquatica-B. filifolia and B. guehoi-B. liniflora-B. rorida. Although members of the complex had conservative symmetric karyotypes, they were clearly differentiated on chromosomal rDNA distribution patterns. The sequence data indicated that ITS was almost homogeneous in all taxa in which two or four 45S rDNA arrays were frequently found at distal regions of chromosomes in the somatic karyotype. ITS homogenization could have been prompted by relatively distal 45S rDNA positions. In contrast, 2-12 5S rDNA arrays were mapped onto proximal/interstitial regions of chromosomes, and some paralogous 5S-NTS were found in the genomes harboring 4 or more arrays. 5S-NTS sequence type-specific FISH analysis showed sequence heterogeneity within and between some 5S rDNA arrays. Interlocus homogenization may have been hampered by their proximal location on chromosomes. Chromosomal location may have affected the contrasting evolutionary dynamics of rDNAs in the B. liniflora complex.},

AIM OF THE STUDY To determine the anti-inflammatory effects of Drosera species and to investigate a substitute material for Droserae Herba, we examined the effect of extracts of Drosera rotundifolia, Drosera tokaiensis and Drosera spatulata on activated T cell membrane (aTc-m)-induced inflammatory gene expression in HMC-1 human mast cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS Drosera rotundifolia, Drosera spatulata and Drosera tokaiensis were collected in Japan. Herbs were extracted with 80\% EtOH, and subsequently applied to OASIS HLB column. HMC-1 cells were treated with each Drosera column-adsorbed fraction for 15min, and subsequently added to aTc-m and incubated for 16h. Inflammatory gene and protein expressions were determined by DNA microarray, RT-PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS Drosera rotundifolia and Drosera tokaiensis fractions, but not the Drosera spatulata fraction, suppressed inflammatory gene expression induced by aTc-m in HMC-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS Drosera rotundifolia and Drosera tokaiensis suppressed activation of HMC-1 cells induced by aTc-m. Since the Drosera tokaiensis fraction was more effective than the traditionally used Drosera rotundifolia, Drosera tokaiensis is a likely substitute as a source of Droserae Herba.},

The rbcL analysis to estimate the species as maternal inheritance revealed that the highest similarity to the hexaploid sequence was found in that of the tetraploid. In contrast, the nuclear rDNA analysis clarified that the hexaploid had two types of ITS sequences: One type of the sequence showed the highest sequence similarity to ITS in D. rotundifolia L. genome, while another type of sequence showed the highest sequence similarity to ITS in the tetraploid D. spathulata Labill. genome. These results suggested that the hexaploid genome could be derived from amphiploidizaion between ancestor species of D. rotundifolia as paternal genome, and the tetraploid D. spathulata as maternal genome.},

Here it is shown that the butanol-soluble fraction of bitter gourd placenta extract strongly suppresses LPS-induced TNFα production in RAW 264.7 cells. Gene expression analysis using a fibrous DNA microarray showed that the bitter gourd butanol fraction suppressed expression of various LPS-induced inflammatory genes, such as those for TNF, IL1α, IL1β, G1p2, and Ccl5. The butanol fraction significantly suppressed NFκB DNA binding activity and phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK MAPKs.
