Our primary focus is on the analysis of carnivorous plants, with the aim of exploring a variety of topics within evolutionary biology. Key areas of research include the following.

#### Evolutionary innovations

The trapping leaves of carnivorous plants originated from ordinary leaves specialized in photosynthesis. Despite being leaves, they possess the ability to attract and capture small insects and digest and assimilate nutrients, much like the digestive systems of animals. By studying these innovative traits, we aim to push the boundaries of evolutionary biology.

#### Convergent evolution

The saying "history repeats itself" finds a parallel in the natural world through the phenomenon of convergent evolution, where organisms not closely related independently evolve similar traits. This widespread occurrence is evident across the entire tree of life. Convergent evolution is exemplified by the development of powered flight in both birds and bats, as well as the adaptation to diving seen in dolphins, dugongs, and platypuses. This phenomenon is also evident in carnivorous plants, which have evolved independently across approximately ten different lineages. By examining these "green hunters", we gain insights into the mechanisms and reasons behind convergent evolution.

#### Phenotypic plasticity

Organisms have the remarkable ability to modify their physical forms in reaction to environmental changes, a process known as phenotypic plasticity. A fascinating example of phenotypic plasticity is seen in some carnivorous plants, which develop distinct types of leaves for trapping prey and conducting photosynthesis. Notably, trapping leaves are derived from photosynthetic leaves, suggesting that this plasticity could provide insights into how carnivorous traits evolved. To unravel this mystery, we are studying the Australian pitcher plant Cephalotus follicularis.
