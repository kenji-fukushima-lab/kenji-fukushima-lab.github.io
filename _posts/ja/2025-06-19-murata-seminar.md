- 開催日: 2025/06/19
- 時間: 16:00-17:00
- 場所: 図書館3階セミナー室 / Seminar room-Library 3F
- 演者: Takashi Murata (Kanagawa Institute of Technology)
- 演題: Cell Division and Movement of the Green Alga Closterium
- 要旨: The conjugation green algae, such as the desmid Closterium, are the key group for understanding plant evolution, because they are the closest sister group of land plants. Here, I will introduce cytokinesis and following cell separation in Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale complex, the model organism of desmids. After completion of cytokinesis, the daughter cells start to expand at the region of septum, and two daughter cells are separated by re-establishment of the cell half called semicell. For understanding mechanism of the cell separation, we visualized microtubule reorganization by expression of mCitrine-tubulin. Preceding the semicell expansion, microtubules formed a disc on the septum. Because cellulose was detected on the septum and microtubule inhibitor blocked semicell expansion, we hypothesize that the microtubule disc recruits cellulose synthase onto the septum. The proposed mechanism of cell wall synthesis is different from the case of land plants, in which callose is first synthesized in the cell plate. In the seminar, I will introduce movement machinery of Closterium, in addition to the mechanism of cell separation.
