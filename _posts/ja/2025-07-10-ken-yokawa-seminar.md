NIGセミナーページ: [https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/ja/research/seminer-ja?id=1729](https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/ja/research/seminer-ja?id=1729)

- 開催日: 2025/07/10
- 時間: 15:30-16:30
- 場所: 図書館3階セミナー室 / Seminar room-Library 3F
- 演者: Ken Yokawa (Graduate School of Engineering, Kitami Institute of Technology)
- 演題: Anesthesia and plants: What is the significance of being susceptible to anesthesia?
- 要旨: Anesthesia is essential for many medical treatments, especially surgery. A considerable amount of anesthetic drugs are being produced industrially and used all over the world. Anesthesia for medical purposes was coincidentally introduced only in the 19th century. Since then, many different kinds of chemicals have been discovered to induce anesthesia effects. However, the exact mode of the anesthetic drug action on the nervous system is still undiscovered. One of the deep mysteries is how these different compounds, with no structural similarities (even a simple substance like xenon), can behave as anesthetic agents, inducing loss of consciousness. We have reported that moving plants, such as Mimosa pudica or Venus flytraps, lose their response to touch stimuli under anesthesia, due to the loss of action potentials and a change in cell membrane status. In the seminar, I will discuss the potential targets of anesthetics in the living system by sharing a recent result of gene expression under anesthetized Arabidopsis.
