2024年10月31日〜11月1日に基礎生物学研究所を訪問し、福島がセミナー発表を行いました。

- Name: Kenji Fukushima
- Affiliation: National Institute of Genetics
- Title: Macroevolution, convergence, and plants that eat
- Abstract: Phenotypic innovations that define large taxonomic groups often lack intraspecific variation, making genetic analysis challenging and leaving many biological questions unanswered. However, the repeated evolution of many of these innovative traits across the tree of life offers an opportunity to study biological patterns through recurrent evolutionary events. Recent research has shown that traits evolving convergently often arise from identical genetic changes, suggesting that studying convergent evolution at the molecular level can uncover the genetic basis of novel traits, even in organisms that are difficult to study in the lab. We developed bioinformatics tools and combined them with experimental approaches to analyze molecular convergent evolution in gene sequences, expression, and other aspects underlying phenotypic innovations. Applying these methods to carnivorous plants, we have identified genes that reveal new insights into their biology, including the unique features of their digestive systems. In this talk, I will highlight how harnessing the vast diversity of life can provide new opportunities to link genotypes with macroevolutionary phenotypes.
