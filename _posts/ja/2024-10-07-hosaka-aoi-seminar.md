- 要旨: Advances in NGS technologies are changing the paradigm of biology; while it was once common to refer to the genome information of closely related model organisms, it has now become essential to determine the genome information of the organisms used in the project. A draft genome of an organism is not an end goal but rather a starting point for further studies. NGS technologies are now spreading into industrial societies, and many companies have recognized the importance of genomic information in their key resources and are attempting to utilize it for research and development. I have assembled several genomes in response to industry demands. These private genomes from various species have provided a rich perspective. In this seminar, we will introduce several exciting genome projects driven by industrial needs.
