- 演題: Dissecting the mechanism of adaptive pollen number reduction in Arabidopsis thaliana
- 要旨: Many angiosperms have hermaphroditic flowers, which enable them to select their mating systems—either outcrossing or selfing. Their flowers contain specific structures and functions to adapt their reproductive strategies. The transition from outcrossing to selfing is common among angiosperms, and selfing has evolved independently in many plant species. Flowers of selfing plants often show shared traits, such as reduced pollen numbers, known as "selfing syndromes." Recently, RDP1 (Reduced Pollen Number 1) was identified as a gene that controls pollen number and is under positive selection to decrease pollen number, indicating that investing less in male gametes is advantageous for selfing plants. However, identifying genes involved in this evolution has been limited to variations within species, and the mechanisms controlling pollen number remain unclear. In this talk, I will discuss the identification of genes responsible for reducing pollen number in the selfing plant Arabidopsis thaliana using interspecific comparison approaches with its outcrossing relative Arabidopsis lyrata.
