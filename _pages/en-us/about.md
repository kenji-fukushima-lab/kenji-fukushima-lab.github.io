Evolution has led to remarkable innovations in the structures and functions of organisms, sometimes reaching levels that seem almost unbelievable. Our research aims to demystify these evolutionary marvels by integrating computational and experimental approaches to study a wide range of organisms, with a particular focus on plants.

Our primary interest lies in insect-trapping carnivorous plants, which derive nutrients from their captured prey. By studying these unique plants, we aim to enhance our understanding of key concepts in evolutionary biology.
