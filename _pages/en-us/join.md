## Overview

Our team is continually seeking talented individuals to join us. We are open to applications for positions as postdoctoral fellows or PhD students. Should you be interested in any of these roles, please reach out to Kenji Fukushima for further details.

Our laboratory operates in an English-speaking environment, and we warmly welcome international students and postdoctoral researchers. We are also happy to assist you with your application for fellowships and scholarships.

## Choosing a research topic

Research topics for new members are chosen collaboratively by the candidate and Kenji, based on the candidate's interests and expertise. We prefer projects that align with at least one of our ongoing research areas (materials, technology, or biological phenomena), because this improves feasibility. We also welcome entirely new ideas with strong potential for discovery.

## Joining as a PhD student

At NIG, PhD courses are offered in English. Although NIG is primarily a research institute, we are affiliated with [SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies)](https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/), which offers an extensive PhD program. SOKENDAI offers both a 3-year PhD program (for applicants with a master's degree) and a 5-year PhD program (for applicants without one). Please note that we generally do not have a master's-only program.

For further details, including information on tuition and fellowships, please consult the links provided below. NIG also offers an internship program specifically designed for undergraduate students. If you are interested in this opportunity, we encourage you to contact us for more information.

## Joining as a postdoc

We announce open postdoc positions through various channels, including the [NIG career page](https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/career-development/jobs-at-nig) and [JREC-IN](https://jrecin.jst.go.jp/seek/SeekTop?ln=1). Please contact Kenji if you would like to hear about potential openings before they are publicly announced.

If you are interested in starting new research in our lab, we advise you to apply for fellowships such as [JSPS Fellowships](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/), [HFSP Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://www.hfsp.org/), or [NIG Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/career-development/nigpostdoc2024#:~:text=The%20National%20Institute%20of%20Genetics,NIG%20and%20fostering%20researchers%20with). We will provide support during the application process.

Should your research interests align with Kenji's areas of interest, there is a possibility that Kenji can seek research funding. However, please note that this process, from initial preparation to funding acceptance, typically takes more than a year.
